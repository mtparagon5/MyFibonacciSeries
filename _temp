# Start by assigning a string to our variable.

# Let's see what the built-in `type()`function does.

# notation, starting at index zero.

# We can use the built-in `len()` function to get a string's
# "length", or the number of characters it contains.

# We can concatenate two strings together into one string with
# the `+` operator.
